a. 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 
   From 0 to 4 are pushed into stack and poped.
   After that 5 to 9 are pushed into stack and poped.
   so, it is posible.

b. 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
   In this sequence, all nine numbers are pushed into stack and poped from the stack but
   at the end 0 is poped before 1. It is not posible. so, the sequence is not posible.

c. 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0

   stack operations:  
 
   0 1 2 (2 was poped)        - 2
   0 1 3 4 5 (5 was poped)    - 5 
   0 1 3 4 6 (6 was poped)    - 6
